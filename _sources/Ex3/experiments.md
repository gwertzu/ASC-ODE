# (TODO) Experminents using the extended implementation

## Automatic differentiation

The upstream version didn't use automatic differentiation, instead it relied on numeric diffrentiation. Changing this to use the `src/autodiff.hpp` from this library ensures better accuracy.

## Tests

Please upload tests already done and extend this!
